# Colors
A PHP script that can generate a 9 hue color palette from a single hex code

Demo: http://csskarma.com/php-colors/?hex=657789

Any source code that was repurposed should be annotated in Color.php, if it isn't, please let me know as I'm sure I just forgot.

## Dependencies
PHP and a server to run it on.
